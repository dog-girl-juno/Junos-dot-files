# Juno's dot files
My custom dot files that I use on arch with i3.

1) install MonofurNerdFont from nerd fonts to your font folder. This is the font i use, and it is required for the icons to display correctly, including those cute little pawprints!
2) refresh i3, and the changes should take effect.

3) some tweaking may be required for your monitor outputs. Mine are set as HDMI-1 and DP-0, your monitors will likely have different names.
run xrandr in your terminal to get the proeper outputs. rather than declairing the correct orientation i used arandr in the CLI because im lazy. 

4) if you are on an amd card, comment out the nvidia startup command at the begining of the i3 config file. this will be of no use to you and may cause conflicts

5) For picom i am using picom-git from the AUR

Some of these files are not modified yet, please bare with me, I am in fact, just a silly doggo 󱙵󱙵󱙵
