#The JunoBytes dot files
Here are my dot files, new and old. I will clean them up eventually and sort them into new and old categories, but feel free to poke around all the files. Most are dog themed, and I use nerd fonts to get the icons to show up. So I reccomend installing MonoFur Nerd Font, but any nerd font will do.

Some of these files are not modified yet, please bare with me, I am in fact, just a silly doggo
